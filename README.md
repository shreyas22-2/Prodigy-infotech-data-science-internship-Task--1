"I am excited to submit my solution for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship program at `Prodigy Infotech`.This task involved conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset, with a specific focus on crafting informative visualizations to illustrate the distribution patterns of a selected categorical or continuous variable."

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href="https://github.com/kindo-tk/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/worldpopulationdata.csv">world_population_dataset</a>. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 



## Conclusion

"In conclusion, this exploratory data analysis (EDA) process yielded crucial insights into the distribution of the chosen variable within the dataset. By uncovering these patterns and trends, we've established a solid foundation for subsequent data modeling and analysis, paving the way for informed decision-making in the data science workflow."

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
